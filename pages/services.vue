                            transparently in advance, so you will never pay more than we settle on. We require a deposit

                            Each project is different in its scope or assignment. We'll give you an approximate timeline
                            only after the first meeting (or phone call), where we'll find out what we'll do. We work in
                            sprints and deliver part of the project every week.

                            In our experience, the best solution is to divide the project into several parts that work
                            independently. This way, you will be able to launch the project much earlier, and gradually
                            improve it. It is also necessary to consider that many delays will arise on the client's side
                            (late submission of documents, delayed feedback, etc.).

                            In the beginning, Amatri, who is in charge of onboarding clients, will guide you through the
                            entire process, pricing, and project preparation. Each project has its manager, usually a
                            designer, who is also a part of the team. This removes unnecessary communication noise and
                            prevents your project from being managed by someone who knows little about it.
